# The technologist's career path at GDS

The information in this section expands on the [technologists career path](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) at GDS, which applies to the [Software Engineering community](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/communities-of-practice/software-engineering-1).

More generally, the civil service is adopting the [Digital, Data and Technology Profession Capability Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework), which outlines the various roles and responsibilities of technologists working in government. That framework covers a wider range of digital skills beyond just software engineering.

## Progression within software engineering
The career path covers the most common paths for career progression within the software engineering community.

Those paths are:
- apprentice technolgoist -> junior technologist -> developer -> senior developer -> lead developer
- apprentice technologist -> junior technologist -> web ops -> senior web ops -> lead web ops
- moving between (senior) developer, (senior) web ops, or reliability engineer roles

Your line manager is responsible for your career progression within GDS and the civil service.

## Roles that are not job titles
### Technical lead
Any mid level or senior level technologist act as the technical lead for a project.

This role is flexible - you can go back to a non-tech lead role after trying it out, and when deciding who should tech lead a team we prioritise exposing new people to the role.

### Incident lead
Anyone can take on a lead role during an incident.

For example, on GOV.UK there is a rota for platform support. If there is an incident, the first person on-call will typically become the incident lead.

## Competencies
Competencies are specific skills, behaviours, and knowledge that help you perform your role.

The list below elaborates on the kinds of competencies mentioned in the career path. Each one should define what we expect at junior, mid and senior level.

These competencies do not generally distinguish between developers, web operations engineers and site reliability engineers.

### Technical skills
- Using version control
- Using a systematic approach to solving problems

## Ways of learning at GDS

All civil servants are entitled to [5 days of learning and development each year](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/training-and-development-opportunities-in-the-the-civil-service).

Junior developers can use 20% of their time for learning, for example, by working on a self-contained project.

You can ask questions about learning and development in #ask-learning-and-devt on slack.

### Private study
It's ok to ask your team for time to study something.

Study materials could include books, videos, or guided tutorials.

GDS has a [library](https://gds-library.cloudapps.digital) and subscriptions to [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) that you can use.

If other people have similar learning goals to you, also consider organising a group to learn together, or presenting back what you've learned to other people.

### Formal training
You can book training through the people development form. Talk to #ask-learning-and-devt on slack if you have any questions.

Formal training can include:

- External training courses
- Conferences
- Civil service learning

### Informal training
Informal training can include:

- [Internal workshops](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/08/09/our-web-security-workshop-for-gds-developers/)
- Group study/activities
- User group meetups
- Attending [technospectives](https://trello.com/b/0T7BR3gT/technospectives) or other presentations

If you are interested in running a new workshop or group, first check if anyone has run anything similar before, as they may be able to share advice and materials.

### On the job learning

Many skills are best developed through working on a project as part of a team.

This can include:

- building and supporting software
- participating in code reviews
- attending incident reviews
- participating in show & tells
- writing and speaking about your work externally

It's often a good idea to talk to your delivery manager (or technical lead) about your learning objectives, so they can help you learn on the job.
