## Knowing when to ask for help

Building software systems is complex. Nobody knows all the answers. Don't be afraid to ask!

We work in collaborative multi-disciplenary teams so that we can combine our diverse skills and knowldege. Even very experienced people rely on input from others. There's no shame in asking if you're not sure about something, if you didn't understand or if you want a second opinion. It's usually better to ask for help than to struggle away on your own trying to figure something out.
