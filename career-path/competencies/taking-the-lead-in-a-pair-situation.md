## Taking the lead in a pairing situation

### The developers role

Pair programming is an important practice for improving the rate at which development teams can deliver valuable high quality software.

When practiced effectively, it has a number of specific benefits:

- it helps to spread a common mental model of the design of the software
- it improves the flow of work by increasing the speed of flow and reducing work-in-progress

## Elaboration of the benefits

Why does having a common mental model help?
Programming as theory building :-)

two brains on a problem is better than one
getting stories to flow faster through the team reduces code conflicts (lower work in progress = less complexity noise, more team focus)

It is also something that requires investment and practice. Adapting the way you work to suit your pair and noticing their strengths/weaknesses and energy levels is important for working effectively and not burning out.

### Junior level
- Have a clear understanding of the story, be able to explain it to your pair
- Discuss approaches with pair
- Use techniques such as ping pong (one person writes the test the other implements) to ensure rotation of roles
- Collaborate with pair to agree an order for tasks
- Recognise when to take breaks

### Mid level
- Take responsibility for ensuring your pair remains engaged, slowing down when needed
- Give feedback to your pair on style 
- Recognise when to take time away from the computer to explain concepts and ideas - using whiteboards e.t.c.
- Draw pair into discussion around design and approach

### Senior level
- Effectively pair with developers of all levels. 
- Recognise the strengths and weakenesses of your pair, and how these relate to your own strengths and weaknesses. Use this knowledge to adapt behaviour appropriately
