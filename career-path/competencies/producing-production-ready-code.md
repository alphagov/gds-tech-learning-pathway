# Producing production ready code

### The developers role

Writing code is a core part of software development, of course!

However your responsibility as a developer extends beyond producing the code
itself. As a developer you are responsible for the whole release process, from code review to
deployment on a production system. You should also ensure that the products you are
working on are easy to support and operate.
