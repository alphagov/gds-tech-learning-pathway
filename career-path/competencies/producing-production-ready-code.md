# Producing production ready code

### The developers role

Writing code is a core part of software development, of course!

However your responsibility as a developer extends beyond producing the code
itself. As a developer you are responsible for the whole release process, from code review to
deployment on a production system. You should also ensure that the products you are
working on are easy to support and operate.

### Junior level

Working with a more experienced developer, you should be able to produce code of a sufficient quality standard to ship to production.

You should:

- be familiar with the language and tools your team uses.
- follow coding conventions/styleguides for your language
- understand that code is read more often that it is written
- prefer to refactor and reuse code rather than duplicating it
- [use automated testing](/career-path/competencies/using-appropriate-testing-to-ensure-software-quality.md)

### Mid level

You should be able to reliably produce production ready code without assistance.

When working on stories you should consider non-functional requirements, such as performance
and security. If you are working on the frontend, you should also be aware of common accessibility
issues.

You should be able to deploy and operate your software in production.

### Senior level

Your code must be flawless and never break*
