# Handling incidents

There are two important aspects to responding to an incident

1. **Psychological factors** -- incidents are by definition unexpected events. This means there's likely to be stress, confusion, noise. You may have alerts, log data, support tickets or angry stakeholders to deal with. When you're stressed you're more likely to make bad decisions, and to rely on snap judgements or jump to conclusions. So the first important aspect of incident response is how you behave, communicate and respond in these circumstances.
2. **Analytical factors** -- having a calm state of mind and clear communication is not enough, you also need to be methodical in how you diagnose and understand the problem, and how you make decisions effectively about what interventions to take.
