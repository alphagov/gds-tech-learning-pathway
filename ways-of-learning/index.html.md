# Ways to learn

All civil servants are entitled to [5 days of learning and development each year](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/training-and-development-opportunities-in-the-the-civil-service).

Junior developers can use 20% of their time for learning, for example, by working on a self-contained project.

You can ask questions about learning and development in #ask-learning-and-devt on slack.

## Private study
It's ok to ask your team for time to study something.

Study materials could include books, videos, or guided tutorials.

GDS has a [library](https://gds-library.cloudapps.digital) and subscriptions to [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) that you can use.

If you know others with similar learning goals, consider organising a group to learn together, or presenting back what you've learned to other people.

## Supported learning

You can learn while being supported by other software developers.

Project Early Talent Assigned Learning (PETAL) is a GDS tech community initiative where you dedicate your 20% time to work on your learning goals with your own bespoke learning project.

A PETAL semester is one day a week, for twelve weeks, and is open to GDS juniors and apprentices. A semester is run by one or two GDS software developers and has a group of other junior peers working on their own learning goals.

Your goals can be anything that will help your technical development, and you will get help to decide a project that is achievable within the semester.

There is some flexibility to how each semester runs, though typically:

- days start with a short standup
- days have a tech talk just for the group
- participants have opportunities to chat and/or pair with software developers and semester peers on whatever topic will help their learning (like knowledge sharing, project planning, coding)
- show and tell sessions every few weeks
- a couple of retrospective sessions where we discuss the semester and how it can be improved

See [#proj-early-talent-assigned-learning](https://gds.slack.com/archives/C05599LTS0J) for information on how to join the next semester.

Interesting in running a PETAL semester? see the guidance for [Running PETAL](./running-petal.md).

## Formal training
You can book training through the people development form. Talk to #ask-learning-and-devt on slack if you have any questions.

Formal training can include:

- External training courses
- Conferences
- Civil service learning

## Informal training
Informal training can include:

- [Internal workshops](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/08/09/our-web-security-workshop-for-gds-developers/)
- Group study/activities
- User group meetups
- Attending [technospectives](https://trello.com/b/0T7BR3gT/technospectives) or other presentations

If you are interested in running a new workshop or group, first check if anyone has run anything similar before, as they may be able to share advice and materials.

## On the job learning

Many skills are best developed through working on a project as part of a team.

This can include:

- building and supporting software
- participating in [code reviews](/resources/other/code-reviews.html.md)
- attending incident reviews
- participating in show & tells
- writing and speaking about your work externally
