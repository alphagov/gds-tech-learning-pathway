# GDS Technology Community - Learning Pathways

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/alphagov/gds-tech-learning-pathway.svg?&style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/alphagov/gds-tech-learning-pathway)

This repository exists to bring together the GDS Technology community's collective knowledge and resources to support the learning and development of technologists.

## Goals

We want to:

- create a set of curated guides, organised by topic, technology, constituency, level. There may be multiple cross-cutting routes into the resources. Our aim is to offer pathways which cater for the most important needs of technologists.
- elaborate the current [technologists career pathways within GDS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_svjdchS8LIyKDF6-FAfVPSuvJmoIRgTQukuxl0XRfM/edit) in more detail, by creating a page for each competency statement in the career path.
- prepare for adopting the [DDaT career pathways within GDS](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-job-roles-in-government#technical:-software-developer-) by documenting our current career pathway in more detail.

## Contents
### Career path
The [technologists career path](/career-path/career-path.md) covers the roles within the software engineering community and common paths for career progression.

We've broken it down into what we call competency statements. These are skills, behaviours and knowledge required at different levels (such as "Using a programming language", "Leading on getting well defined tasks from backlog to production"). We aim to describe as best we can what we expect technologists to demonstrate at each level.

### Resource lists
[Resource lists](/resources) are lists of resources about a specific topic or technology. We don't expect everyone to have expertise in every topic.

To make it easier to keep these up to date, we'd prefer to link out to external resources as much as possible, rather than authoring content in this repository. Resource lists should tell you how to get started with something, and signpost resources which help you learn more about it.

#### Inspiration and general resources
[Inspiration and general resources](/resources/inspiration-and-general-resources.md) links to other projects that are similar to this one.

## Status

This repository is an early draft. We have decided the basic structure and have mapped career path statements to a list of competencies. We are part way through creating pages for each of these.

[Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome in the form of PRs.

## Next steps

For a first pass we are going to:

- create a page for [each competency statement](/career-path/competencies/) on the technologist career path which:
  - describes in a little more detail that particular competency
  - describes the expectation at each level of expertise
  - links to guides which would help to learn that competency
- test whether this is helpful for Juniors in learning

## How to contribute

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Longer term goals

We want to encourage learning collaboratively in the GDS technology community, and so we'll seek to provide ways for:

- people to offer and request mentorship
- people to share what they're wanting to learn so that they can join up with others wanting to learn the same things, or get support from others

However, this repo should not contain any personal names or information because this repo is public.
