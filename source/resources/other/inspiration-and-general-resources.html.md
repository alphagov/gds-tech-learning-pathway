# Inspiration for this project

This is a list of things that inspired the learning pathway project in GDS.

## Trail maps
These inspired what we're calling "resource lists". They take a specific learning goal and draw out a map of how to get there.

- [http://railsbridgetriangle.com/resources/](http://railsbridgetriangle.com/resources/)
- I think that Thoughtbot maybe commercialised their learning offering into [https://thoughtbot.com/upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase)

## Onboarding materials
These are materials created by companies to help out new starters.

- [https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html](https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html) - Google's guide for getting hired as a comp-sci graduate

## Explorable career paths
These are some ways companies have made their career paths transparent.

## Lists of lists
Curated lists of learning materials.

- [https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) a curated list of lists grouped into frontend, backend, languages etc.

## "Things everyone should know"
Lists of topics that may be relevant to technologists, and resources for learning for more about them.

- [http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/) - One of many "everyone should know know this" lists. Not all of it is relevant, but covers technical subjects people might be interested in learning.
