## Contributing

This is a community-driven project and we welcome all contributions. This project is developed under the [Alphagov Code of Conduct](https://github.com/alphagov/code-of-conduct)

Here are a few ways you can help:

1. [Review open pull requests](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-tech-learning-pathway/pulls). You don't have to be an expert on the topic to make suggestions.
2. Improve the copy so it's [easier to understand](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk).
3. Write a competency statement following the [template](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-tech-learning-pathway/blob/master/career-path/competencies/TEMPLATE.md). Speak to someone before starting this as we have a list of competencies and what we think should go in them.
4. Write a resource list for a topic you're interested in, following the [template](resources/TEMPLATE.md)
4. Triage [issues](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-tech-learning-pathway/issues) and work out how they can be incorporated into the existing structure. This might be just adding a link to a resource list.
5. Raise an issue for something that is currently missing from the learning pathway.
